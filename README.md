# Hello Microverse

> In this project, I will be setting up a "Hello world" repository. No complex coding is required for this exercise. My goal here  to master all of the tools and best practices I learned about in previous steps. I will be using them in all Microverse projects and most likely in my future job as well, so it is important to know them!
